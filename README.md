# Call-Centre
I designed this Power BI dashboard to analyze and enhance call center performance by tracking key KPIs and visualizing critical metrics. The dashboard helps businesses optimize customer support, improve efficiency, and boost satisfaction ratings through data-driven insights.

 Key Insights & KPIs:
✔ Total Calls (4054) – Overall volume of customer interactions
✔ Answered Calls (81.08%) – Calls successfully picked up
✔ Resolved Cases (72.92%) – Percentage of issues resolved
✔ Average Satisfaction Rating (2.76/5) – Customer feedback metric
✔ Average Speed of Answer (67.52 sec) – Efficiency of response time
✔ Monthly Breakdown of Calls – Trends in call volume over time

Visualizations:
 Stacked Column Chart – Calls received & answered per month
 Donut Charts – Breakdown of answered vs. unanswered calls and resolution rates
 Gauge Chart – Customer satisfaction rating visualization
 Slicers – Filter data by Agent, Topic, and Time Range

 Business Impact:
 Identifies gaps in customer support to enhance response times
 Tracks agent & department performance for better resource allocation
 Monitors resolution rates to improve problem-solving efficiency
 Analyzes call trends to forecast staffing needs & optimize workload

This dashboard enables real-time monitoring of call center efficiency, helping teams take proactive measures to enhance customer experience.
